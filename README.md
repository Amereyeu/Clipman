# Clipman

The main goal of developing the Clipman was to create a simple clipboard manager extension for GNOME that isn't overloaded with features and settings. Unfortunately, the current analogues of this type of extensions have redundant functionality, while not providing the functionality I need.

### Installation

The extension is available for installation on the [GNOME Shell Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4958/clipman/).

To install manually follow the steps below:

- download the latest version of the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/popov895/Clipman/releases)
- run the following command:

   `$ gnome-extensions install clipman@popov895.ukr.net.zip`

- restart your session (logout and login)
- run the following command:

   `$ gnome-extensions enable clipman@popov895.ukr.net`

This extension uses the following libraries:

- [QR Code generator library](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator)
- [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/)

This extension uses [dpaste.com](https://dpaste.com) to share text online.
