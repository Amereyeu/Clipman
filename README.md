# Clipman

The main goal of developing the Clipman was to create a simple clipboard manager extension for GNOME that isn't overloaded with features and settings. Unfortunately, the current analogues of this type of extensions have redundant functionality, while not providing the functionality I need.

### Installation

Currently, this extension is not yet available for installation from the GNOME Shell Extensions website.

To install manually follow the steps below:

- download the latest version of the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/popov895/Clipman/releases)
- extract the downloaded archive into your local extensions directory (usually **~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/**)
- run the following command:

   `$ gnome-extensions enable clipman@popov895.ukr.net`
